# WJSTestSuite
test suite for the weighted job scheduling problem


Usage:
First, clone the WJSTestSuite directory into the directory that has your payoff_sched executable (such that payoff_sched and WJSTestSuite are in the same directory and on the same level).
Now run the tests by executing the "tests" file (./tests).
